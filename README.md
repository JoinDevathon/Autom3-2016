## Get Started

**If you already know how to use Maven, then more than likely the following steps are irrelevant for you. Just do your usual thing.**

Don't worry, we made a video! Check it out at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5HXS0l-VwQ

---

First things first, you need to have the Java JDK8 installed. You can find the appropriate version here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Then you need to have git installed. You can find the appropriate version for your OS here: https://git-scm.com/

There are no other required dependencies, however Maven is optional if you want to set up your own development environment outside of what we do for you.

## Running

If you're on Windows, you'll want to run all of these commands inside Git Bash, which is a program installed when you installed Git. You can paste by right clicking inside of the window.

If you don't have this Git repository cloned yet, click on clone or download. If you have an SSH key on your account, use the SSH link. Otherwise use the HTTPS link if you want to use your GitHub username and password.

Then run

```bash
git clone <link>
```

To run your server, do:

```bash
./run-server.sh
```

On first run this will download and compile the Spigot version that you're using for the contest. Because you're using this exact version of Spigot for the entire contest, you can safely use CraftBukkit and Minecraft Server code.

This wrapper around the Spigot server has a few extra features that are not included inside of regular Spigot. If you type `stop` to stop the Minecraft Server, it'll automatically recompile your code and restart the server. To fully stop the server, type `exit` to safely stop the server and exit the recompilation loop. If you're on Windows, you won't have a `exit` command and will instead be asked every loop if you want to recompile.
